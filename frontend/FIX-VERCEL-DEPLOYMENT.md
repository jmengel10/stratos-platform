# 🔧 Fix Vercel Deployment - Configure Root Directory

**Problem**: Vercel is trying to build from the root directory instead of the frontend directory  
**Solution**: Configure Vercel to use `frontend` as the root directory  
**Time**: 2 minutes

## ✅ **I'VE FIXED THE CODE**

The TypeScript error is now fixed and pushed to GitHub!

**Latest commit**: "Fix TypeScript error in base-agent - add type assertion"

## 🔧 **FIX VERCEL CONFIGURATION**

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/stratos
2. **Click**: "Settings"
3. **Scroll to**: "Build & Development Settings"
4. **Configure**:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Root Directory**: **frontend** ← IMPORTANT!
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default is fine)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next` (default is fine)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (default is fine)
5. **Click**: "Save"
6. **Go to**: "Deployments"
7. **Click**: "..." on failed deployment → "Redeploy"

**This tells Vercel to only build the frontend directory!**

### Option 2: Via Terminal (Alternative)

If you prefer terminal:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\jonme\Documents\AI Strategy Consulting and Venture Capital"
git pull origin master

cd frontend
vercel
# Follow prompts and it will auto-detect Next.js in frontend/
```

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION**

After reconfiguring, the build should:
- ✅ Only process files in `frontend/`
- ✅ Not see `backend/` files
- ✅ Build successfully in 2-3 minutes
- ✅ Deploy to production

**Expected output**:
```
✅ Build completed
✅ Deployment ready
✅ Production: https://stratos.vercel.app
```

## 📋 **CHECKLIST**

Current Vercel settings should be:

- [x] Output Directory: .next
- [x] Node Version: 18.x or 20.x
