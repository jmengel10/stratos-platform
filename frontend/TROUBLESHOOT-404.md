# üîç Troubleshooting 404 Error

**Problem**: Getting 404 error when visiting Vercel site  
**Let's fix it!**

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE CHECKS**

### Check 1: What URL Are You Using?

**Try these URLs in order**:

1. **Main domain**: https://stratos.vercel.app
2. **With subdomain**: https://stratos-[project-id].vercel.app
3. **Dashboard directly**: https://stratos.vercel.app/dashboard
4. **Settings directly**: https://stratos.vercel.app/settings

**Which URL is giving you the 404?**

---

### Check 2: Is the Deployment Complete?

**Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "**stratos**" project
3. Click on it
4. Look at the latest deployment

**What do you see?**
- ‚úÖ "Ready" with green checkmark = Deployment succeeded
- ‚è≥ "Building" = Still deploying (wait 2-3 min)
- ‚ùå "Error" or "Failed" = Build failed (needs fix)
- üîÑ "Canceled" = Deployment was stopped

---

### Check 3: Get Your Actual URL

**In Vercel Dashboard**:
1. Click on your "**stratos**" project
2. Look for "**Domains**" section (on the project overview)
3. **Copy the actual production URL**

**It might be**:
- stratos.vercel.app
- stratos-[hash].vercel.app
- frontend-[hash].vercel.app
- Or something else

---

## üîß **COMMON FIXES**

### Fix 1: Deployment Still Building

**If status shows "Building"**:
- Wait 2-3 more minutes
- Refresh the page
- Check again

---

### Fix 2: Deployment Failed

**If status shows "Error" or "Failed"**:
1. Click on the failed deployment
2. Click "**View Build Logs**"
3. Look for errors

**Then**:
- Tell me what error you see
- Or click "**Redeploy**" to try again (the latest code should work!)

---

### Fix 3: Wrong URL

**If you're using the wrong URL**:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Find the correct production URL
4. Try that URL instead

---

### Fix 4: Pages Don't Exist Yet

**If only certain pages 404**:

**Current working pages**:
- `/dashboard` - Should work
- `/settings` - Should work
- `/console` - Might not work yet (needs auth)

**Try**:
- https://stratos.vercel.app/dashboard (directly)
- https://stratos.vercel.app/settings (directly)

## üÜò **DETAILED TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Scenario A: Homepage (/) 404s

**This is normal!** We haven't created a homepage yet.

**Solution**: Go directly to:
- https://stratos.vercel.app/dashboard
- https://stratos.vercel.app/settings

---

### Scenario B: All Pages 404

**Cause**: Deployment might have failed or is incomplete

**Fix**:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check deployment status
3. If failed, click "Redeploy"
4. If building, wait for it to finish

---

### Scenario C: Vercel Shows Different URL

**Example**: Your project might be at:
- `frontend-abc123.vercel.app` instead of `stratos.vercel.app`

**Fix**:
1. Use the actual URL Vercel gives you
2. Or configure custom domain in Vercel settings

---

## üìã **CHECKLIST TO GET YOUR ACTUAL STATUS**

**Go to Vercel Dashboard and tell me**:

1. **Project name**: What does it say? (stratos, frontend, etc.)
2. **Deployment status**: Ready, Building, Failed?
3. **Production URL**: What's the actual URL shown?

## üéØ **QUICK DIAGNOSIS**

**Run this in your browser**:
